# Practicing elements, components along with styling bootstrap:

-   Make the section a bootstrap container
-   Give the h1 white text, a dark background, and center-aligned text
-   Make the div an alert ('warning' color). Set the role attribute to alert, for accessibility purposes!
-   Make the first button a green bootstrap button
-   Make the second button a red bootstrap button
